    Note:

    Attributes:

    Input can be of size ``TxBx*`` where T is the length of the longest sequence
    (equal to ``lengths[0]``), B is the batch size, and * is any number of
    dimensions (including 0). If ``batch_first`` is True ``BxTx*`` inputs are
    expected.

    The sequences should be sorted by length in a decreasing order, i.e.
    ``input[:,0]`` should be the longest sequence, and ``input[:,B-1]`` the
    shortest one.

    Note:
        This function accept any input that has at least two dimensions. You
        can apply it to pack the labels, and use the output of the RNN with
        them to compute the loss directly. A Variable can be retrieved from
        a :class:`PackedSequence` object by accessing its ``.data`` attribute.

    Arguments:
        input (Variable): padded batch of variable length sequences.
        lengths (list[int]): list of sequences lengths of each batch element.
        batch_first (bool, optional): if True, the input is expected in BxTx*
