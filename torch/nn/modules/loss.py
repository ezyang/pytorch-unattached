    r"""The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with n classes

    If provided, the optional argument `weights` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes.

    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The input given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class: input has to be a 2D Tensor of size
    `(minibatch, n)`

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.

    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss`  instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The target that this loss expects is a class index
    `(0 to N-1, where N = number of classes)`

    The loss can be described as::

        loss(x, class) = -x[class]

    or in the case of the weights argument it is specified as follows::

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
           class. If given, has to be a Tensor of size "nclasses"
        size_average (bool, optional): By default, the losses are averaged

           size_average is set to False, the losses are instead summed for

        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When size_average

class TripletMarginLoss(Module):
    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the triplet loss given an input
    tensors x1, x2, x3 and a margin with a value greater than 0.
    This is used for measuring a relative similarity between samples. A triplet
    is composed by `a`, `p` and `n`: anchor, positive examples and negative
    example respectively. The shape of all input variables should be
    :math:`(N, D)`.

    The distance swap is described in detail in the paper `Learning shallow
    convolutional feature descriptors with triplet losses`_ by
    V. Balntas, E. Riba et al.

    .. math::
        L(a, p, n) = \frac{1}{N} \left( \sum_{i=1}^N \max \{d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + {\rm margin}, 0\} \right)

    where :math:`d(x_i, y_i) = \| {\bf x}_i - {\bf y}_i \|_2^2`.

    Args:
        anchor: anchor input tensor
        positive: positive input tensor
        negative: negative input tensor
        p: the norm degree. Default: 2

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, D)` where `D = vector dimension`
        - Output: :math:`(N, 1)`

    >>> triplet_loss = nn.TripletMarginLoss(margin=1.0, p=2)
    >>> input1 = autograd.Variable(torch.randn(100, 128))
    >>> input2 = autograd.Variable(torch.randn(100, 128))
    >>> input3 = autograd.Variable(torch.randn(100, 128))
    >>> output = triplet_loss(input1, input2, input3)
    >>> output.backward()
